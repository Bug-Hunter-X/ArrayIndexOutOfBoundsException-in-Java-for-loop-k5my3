This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating a common error: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The bug.java file shows the erroneous code, while bugSolution.java provides the corrected version.  The error arises from an off-by-one error in the loop condition when iterating over an array.  The solution highlights the importance of using < instead of <= when accessing array elements using index.
